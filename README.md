# IEEE-Player-Character-Voice-Installer-Pack-
This combines IEEE ASfPC and IEEE PCVI in one package and also offers demos for testing.

## More Information
* More detailed information(Features, Compatibility, Languages, etc.) about [IEEE ASfPC](https://github.com/Incrementis/IEEE-Audacity-Savefiles-for-Player-Character-) and [IEEE PCVI](https://github.com/Incrementis/IEEE-Player-Character-Voice-Installer-/tree/main) can be found in the respective repositories.

To make it a little clearer, I assume that not everyone is using Audacity for recordings, so I made two projects and put them into a package.

I use the package at a meta level like this:

1. Record and rename voice lines via IEEE ASfPC
2. Distribute the renamed voice lines and make them available as an installable mod via IEEE PCVI
3. The demos show what the end result could look like

I recommend reading the wikis and guides that the projects offer.

## Demos
The demos for the respective game are ready for installation. There are demos for:
* BG:EE (Baldur's Gate:Enhanced Edition) tested version is 2.6.6.0
* SoD (Siege of Dragonspear) tested version is 2.6.6.0
* BG2:EE (Baldur's Gate 2:Enhanced Edition) tested version is 2.6.6.0
* IWD:EE (Icewind Dale:Enhanced Edition) tested version is 2.6.6.0

## Troubleshooting
### There are known issues when installing SOD as DLC for BG:EE
* [DLCmerger](https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases) is recommended for installation
